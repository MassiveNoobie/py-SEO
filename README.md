# py-SEO scripts to help you increase your google ranking
In this repo i will share python seo scripts to help you increase your google ranking, however I suggest nothing goes full automated mode until you're really happy with the human in the loop systems I will be sharing here.

# why
C my friend I'm teaching SEO. In process i'm giving away all of the tools openly here. If i typing saying C, i can teach this easier.

You don't know seo, and learning it can be a rabbit hole, I want to make it easy.

# seo backlinks
Backlinks from websites with traffic, intent clicks, from a good website. Like YOUTUBE is really good backlinks, and if you're willing to be consistent, perhaps a safer place to gain links. 

Once you establish this link, the blue link, hyper link, do follow, you're in a good place. You need these from good websites.

# negative SEO
People will pick up on this, they get signals when you do good, and do what they can to hurt you if they can't 1 up you, like making a farm of "anti-ranking links" the anti SEO juice, the anti ranking, they are doing this using a lot of solutions I've created in the past. 

Mostly they funnel RSS feeds to their website, this brings them a limited amount of traffic of people who are savy and wondering "why am I getting a link" oh it's that website. And as we sit there trying to figure out if it's real, that company just gained what appeared to be a legit person, someone manually trying to study their page. This is engagement.

# seo RSS reposting studies on my domain
It works. If you cut out the ones that dont get traffic, and manage the rss feed transformation process enough, it works just fine.

I created https://tylergarrett.com as a test example, All (41,339) | Published (41,305) | the traffic swells as you get going on this and if you have a good enough looking website, you often trick people into hanging out a little longer. I found mixing news in a system I designed was the best practice. Then I sneak in some healthy little blue friends, blacklinks to whatever I need to go up or down.

#why people seeing your SEO is a big deal
people see that C, with websites like moz, ahrefs, etc (companies make money doing the opposite of what google search console does) and they try to down grade you how they know how. It's easier to make you go down VS up.

You can see their seo, moz has a free app you can use 3 times per day. just dont go down the rabbit hole, it gets dark down there and pointless.

# why py?
python is awesome for running bots on websites to grab information.

and we need to study spam websites who are aiming links at your website and trying to harm your website. 

there's a few places to look to get this information, our core focus will be improving GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE disavowing process. if you research disavow right now, you're going to see a lot of people saying it's not worth the time. but why are people actively pushing off something google is recommending as a good practice? the deeper you go, more advanced people will suggest you should disavow. However the most immediate knowledge funnels suggest "don't disavow backlinks?" I feel this is an attempt to guide SEO searches towards suggesting it's not a good practice to stop toxic link spam.
a repo where I dump all the python I'm using in seo

#future goal
1. release exact scripts to getting websites under the radar and potentially closed.

so far i've been able to get 1 of 2 websites shutdown by their host provider and will include all of those interactions to help you improve your seo game. more to come here, i've only tried one day. and i see a bot could have easily done all of this work for me and used my email template. great news, a simply py bot maybe able to shutdown websites too.

2. create more py scripts


3. organize other repos with py seo apps into this area


4. make a worthy SEO system that helps you with keeping it ranked high.
