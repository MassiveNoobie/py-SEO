# py-SEO
Hey, how's it going C. C my friend I'm teaching SEO. In process i'm giving away all of the tools openly here.

You don't know seo, and learning it can be a rabbit hole. So let me break down the main goals.

Backlinks from websites with traffic, intent clicks, from a good website.

Once you establish this link, the blue link, hyper link, do follow, you're in a good place. You need these from good websites.

People will pick up on this and do what they can to create "anti-blue links" the anti SEO juice, the anti ranking, they are doing this using a lot of solutions I've created in the past. Mostly they funnel RSS feeds to their website, this brings them a limited amount of traffic of people who are savy and wondering "why am I getting a link" oh it's that website. And as we sit there trying to figure out if it's real, that company just gained what appeared to be a legit person, someone manually trying to study their page. This is engagement.

I created https://tylergarrett.com as a test example, All (41,339) | Published (41,305) | the traffic swells as you get going on this and if you have a good enough looking website, you often trick people into hanging out a little longer. I found mixing news in a system I designed was the best practice. Then I sneak in some healthy little blue friends, blacklinks to whatever I need to go up or down.

Yo, people see that C, and they try to down grade you how they know how. It's easier to make you go down VS up.

# why py?
lets face it, python is awesome for running bots on websites to grab information.

and we need to study spam websites who are aiming links at your website and trying to harm your website. 

there's a few places to look to get this information, our core focus will be improving GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE disavowing process. if you research disavow right now, you're going to see a lot of people saying it's not worth the time. but why are people actively pushing off something google is recommending as a good practice? the deeper you go, more advanced people will suggest you should disavow. However the most immediate knowledge funnels suggest "don't disavow backlinks?" I feel this is an attempt to guide SEO searches towards suggesting it's not a good practice to stop toxic link spam.
a repo where I dump all the python I'm using in seo

future goal, release exact scripts to getting websites under the radar and potentially closed.

so far i've been able to get 1 of 2 websites shutdown by their host provider and will include all of those interactions to help you improve your seo game. more to come here, i've only tried one day. and i see a bot could have easily done all of this work for me and used my email template. great news, a simply py bot maybe able to shutdown websites too.
